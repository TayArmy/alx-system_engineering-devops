As a software engineering student, I recently learned about the fascinating processes that occurs by just entering a simple action into our web browsers. For example when you enter a URL like https://www.google.com into a browser and press enter a series of complex processes occur
First, it attempts to resolve the domain with an IP address by sending a request to the DNS server to translate the website's domain name into an IP address. When the DNS server gets your request, it returns the IP address of the website you are attempting to access. 
Once the domain name has been resolved into an IP address the browser then initiates a TCP connection with the server using a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) handshake by using the IP address retrieved from the DNS server through your browser to establish a TCP/IP connection with the server hosting the website. This request and response first passes through a firewall, which is a security system that monitors and restricts incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security criteria.

Once the TCP connection is established the browser sends an http get request to the web server. This is called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) protocol. To safeguard the data being communicated, this protocol employs Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption.
Depending on the load of the server you might require a load-balancer, this is a program that knows what servers are available for you to work with, meaning it disperses traffic among multiple servers so that no single server becomes overburdened. When a request reaches the server, web server software such as Apache or Nginx receives it and processes it. It obtains the requested page and returns it to the browser via the TCP/IP connection that has been established.
If a webpage requires data from a database, the web server talks with the database server to obtain the necessary information. The data is then subsequently returned to the database server by the web server, which includes it in the response.
To conclude, browsing a webpage entails a complicated series of activities that occur in a couple of seconds. Understanding these processes can help us appreciate the extraordinary labor that goes on behind the scenes to make everything happen.
